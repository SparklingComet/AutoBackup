#      AutoBackup      #
# +------------------+ #

# Information:
# - ${project.name} - ${project.description}
#   by ${author}
# - This config was first generated for plugin version ${project.version}
# - If you need to regenerate the default config, delete or rename this file
#   and restart the server.
# - Please consider re-generating the config after updating the plugin because otherwise
#   new config options will not show up.
#
#  DOCUMENTATION
#  To avoid cluttering of the config, most comments were removed in version v1.1.1.
#  The explanations and the default settings can be found on the wiki:
#  https://github.com/SparklingComet/AutoBackup/wiki/Configuration
#  Please consult the documentation when in doubt in order to avoid mistakes.


# +------------- Start of Config -------------+

# Disable plugin version checking system.
disable-updater: false

# Determines which kind of backup to perform on default, aka when the command '/backup default' is run.
default-modes: ['overworld', 'nether', 'end']

# Determines whether to exclude the backup directory from a potential backup.
# It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you leave this to the default setting (true)! Check the wiki for more information (link
# above)
exclude-backup: true

# Determines whether the paths in this config are to be taken relative to the Minecraft server root
# as opposed to actual system root. Leave the default option (true) unless you know what you
# are doing and you would like to export the backups outside your Minecraft server directory.
relative-paths: true

# Determines where to save the backups.
# WARNING: Only change if you know what you are doing! Check the wiki (link above) for more information.
backup-dir: '/backups'

# Determines whether or not to log to console when backups are performed successfully (recommended).
# If a backup fails, the plugin will log it regardless of whether this option is set to true or false.
# This also determines whether or not the console should be notified when the backups are purged (recommended).
log-to-console: true

# Determines whether or not to perform the first iteration of a scheduled backup cycle on server start
# and on plugin reload, or wait the scheduled time interval before the first cycle.
immediate-backup: false

# Determines whether the console is allowed to perform a backup even if manual trigger for the backup
# (allow-manual option) is disabled.
allow-force-console: true

# Sets the min amount of players that need to be on for the backup to be performed.
# If the number is set to '0' (default) or negative, backups will always be performed.
# Manual backups by admins via '/ab default' or '/ab take <mode>' will always be performed.
min-players: 0

# Should AutoBackup log all backups to the backup-log.txt file? Should AutoBackup log which entity (player or console)
# issued the backup? If log-entity is 'false', only the path will be logged.
backup-log:
  enable: true
  log-entity: true
  log-success: true
  log-failure: true

# Should admins be allowed to purge all backups using in-game commands?
allow-players-purge: false

# Should admins be allowed to purge all backups using a console command?
allow-console-purge: true

# Use this configuration section to determine what is backed up.
# Every list entry is a different backup mode. Feel free to add your own modes and remove the examples
# you don't need.
#
# - The mode name (example: everything, plugins, etc) can be chosen freely. Avoid using 'default' though.
# - The dir option determines what folder is backed up. '/' means server root.
# - The allow-manual option determines whether this backup can be performed by the /backup command
# - The schedule option determines whether or not to perform the backup automatically every x minutes, set to 0 or
#   negative to disable.
# - The compression option specifies the degree of the compression. Better compression means less disk space
#   is occupied, but the backup itself takes longer.
#   Possible settings: -1 (No compression); 0 (Default Compression); 1 (Best speed); 2 (Best Compression).
#   More about this on the wiki (link at the top)
# - The recursive option determines whether to backup only the files at the given path (false) or also the files inside
#   the subdirectories of the given path (true)
# - The purge-after option determines after how many minutes a backup should expire. That means, on each backup performing,
#   it will check the expiry of any living backup in the backups folder.
#   A value of 0 or a negative value will disable automatic purging of expired backups.
#
# NOTE: These are just (working) examples! You should add and tweak the ones you need and get rid of those you
# do not need. In particular, the backup 'everything' is extremely inefficient and can take very long times. It
# is therefore highly discouraged. You should rather setup separate smaller backups, ie. one for plugin data, one for
# each world, etc.
